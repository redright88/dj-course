# Code Samples
# Initialize a new string:

String.new

# Initialize a new string with an argument:

String.new("Jason")

# Initialize a new array:

Array.new

# Creating your own initialize method:

class MyClass
  def initialize
    puts "This is the initialize method."
  end
end

MyClass.new

# This will print out the following:

# This is the initialize method.


# Coding Challenge

# 1. Instantiate a new instance of the String class and assign the newly instantiated instance to the variable string.

string = String.new

# 2. Instantiate a new instance of the Array class and assign the newly instantiated instance to the variable array.

array = Array.new
